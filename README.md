# Number Analyzer

This is my very first C program.

Welcome to the Number Analyzer!
This program will let you enter an integer,
identify if it's positive or negative,
and finally, check if it's odd or even.

Enter a number: 7
You entered: 7
Your number is: Positive.
Your number is: Odd.

Enter a number: -4
You entered: -4
Your number is: Negative.
Your number is: Even.

Enter a number: 0
You entered: 0
Your number is 0
Your number is: Even.
